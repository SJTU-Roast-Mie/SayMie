# SayMie

please say mie! a slack and gitter like website.

It will support

- [ ] chat (gfw markdown + highlight)
- [ ] webhook for gitlab (because we use gitlab instead of github for our own projects :) )
- [ ] full text search

### TODO

#### Basic env

1. auth using devise
2. ajax call using grape for API
3. the single page app using angularjs + ui-router


#### Realtime stuff

1. browser chat using LeanCloud ( a Parse like service provider in China)
2. browser chat using Socket.io ( for host this website on your own server)

#### Enhancement

1. allow a white board when chatting ( everyone can edit it like etherpad )
2. a promise marker ( let u mark what u have promised to others during chat )
3. small games for fun, i like coding doesn't mean i wont get bored
